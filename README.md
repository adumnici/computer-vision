This is the front end component for the Computer-vision app, which makes use of Clarifai's API in order to detect faces in pictures.

This component was made using React along with the tachyons package which was used for CSS purposes.

In order to use the app, please use the link next to the name of the repo. Afterwards please register an account/sign-in into an existing account. After login in, you just need to submit a URL of a desired picture, and the app will try to identify if there is a human face in that picture.

That being said, have a got at it and see if it can find all the faces you want!
